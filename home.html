        <h2> Welcome to Astrophysics For All!</h2>
        <p><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-929121a43cf74c8b97fef2ab42de1dd3" class="img-thumbnail float-right" alt="Expanding galaxies"></p>
        <p> According to <a href="https://www.space.com/26218-astrophysics.html#:~:text=Astrophysics%20is%20a%20branch%20of,the%20lines%20between%20them%20blur." target="_blank">Space.com </a>, Astrophysics is a branch of space science that applies the laws of physics and chemistry to explain the birth, life and death of stars, planets, galaxies, nebulae and other objects in the universe. It has two sibling sciences, astronomy and cosmology, and the lines between them blur. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Astronomy measures positions, luminosities, motions and other characteristics</li>
          <li>Astrophysics creates physical theories of small to medium-size structures in the universe</li>
          <li>Cosmology does this for the largest structures, and the universe as a whole.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In practice, the three professions form a tight-knit family. Ask for the position of a nebula or what kind of light it emits, and the astronomer might answer first. Ask what the nebula is made of and how it formed and the astrophysicist will pipe up. Ask how the data fit with the formation of the universe, and the cosmologist would probably jump in. But watch out â€” for any of these questions, two or three may start talking at once!</p>

        <h2> Observational Astrophysics </h2>
        <p> Observational astrophysics is a division of the astronomical science that is concerned with recording and interpreting data, in contrast with theoretical astrophysics, which is mainly concerned with finding out the measurable implications of physical models. It is the practice of observing celestial objects by using telescopes and other astronomical apparatus. The majority of astrophysical observation are made using the elctromagnetic spectrum.</p>
        <p>The study of our very own Sun has a special place in observational astrophysics. Due to the tremendous distance of all other stars, the Sun can be observed in a kind of detail unparalleled by any other star. Our understanding of our Sun serves as a guide to our understanding of other stars.</p>

        <h2> Theoretical Astrophysics </h2>
        <p>Theorists in astrophysics endeavor to create theoretical models and figure out the observational consequences of those models. This helps allow observers to look for data that can refute a model or help in choosing between several alternate or conflicting models.</p>
        <p>Theorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new data. In the case of an inconsistency, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model to fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.</p>
